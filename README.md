## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- I got more practice time with CSS positioning and display.
Although, I tried several css properties targeted at achieving what I wanted. It was an interesting process, writing them and seeing what they actually do, how they turn out.

- I also got a bit comfortable with media query. Understanding it was tough initially. I will say I am getting a hang of it little by little.

- Also, I got better at arranging & organizing my code, making use of comments for each section that I am working with in order to stay organized and on track.

- Although, there were several repititons of property in several class across , Code refactoring & DRY principle is one major area of improvement .


```CSS - I am proud of this 

@media (max-width: 889px){

    .container {
      margin:  auto ;
      width: 300px;
      display: block;
      text-align: center;
    }
}

```

### Continued development

- Media query
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS positioning
- Code Refactoring - DRY Principle
